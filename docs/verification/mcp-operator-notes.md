## MCP Operator Notes

Date: 2026-05-21

### Supported Transports

- Streamable HTTP: preferred remote MCP path for current HTTP servers.
- HTTP: JSON-RPC POST against a configured MCP endpoint.
- SSE: legacy MCP SSE endpoint plus POST callback flow.
- Stdio Bridge: browser talks to a local HTTP bridge; the bridge owns process launch and stdio.
- Native Messaging: the browser talks to an installed native messaging host.

### Reload Requirements

After source changes:

1. Run the build command for the target browser.
2. Open the browser extension management page.
3. Reload the matching unpacked extension directory.
4. Refresh existing `https://chat.deepseek.com/` tabs so the content and main-world scripts pick up the new bundle.

| Browser | Command | Reload target |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Chrome | `npm run build:chrome` | `dist/chrome-mv3/` in `chrome://extensions/` |
| Edge | `npm run build:edge` | `dist/edge-mv3/` in `edge://extensions/` |
| Firefox | `npm run build:firefox` | `dist/firefox-mv3/manifest.json` in `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` |

### MCP Setup Checklist

1. Open the DeepSeek++ sidepanel.
2. Go to `MCP`.
3. Add a server and choose its transport.
4. For HTTP/SSE/bridge transports, click `授权` and approve the browser host permission.
5. Click `测试` to verify initialize/list behavior and latency.
6. Click `刷新工具` to populate the cache.
7. Confirm each tool's enabled state. Only tools with server `auto` policy and enabled tool state are injected into prompts.

### OfficeCLI Provider

OfficeCLI is exposed as a local Streamable HTTP MCP provider. The browser extension does not launch `officecli` directly and does not accept raw shell commands from a skill prompt.

Start the provider:

```bash
npm run officecli:mcp -- --root /path/to/documents
```

Use `--root` repeatedly to allow multiple document folders. Only `.docx`, `.xlsx`, and `.pptx` inputs under those roots are accepted. The provider defaults to read-only behavior; mutation tools return `officecli_write_disabled` until the provider is restarted with:

```bash
npm run officecli:mcp -- --root /path/to/documents --write enabled
```

The sidepanel `OfficeCLI` quick-start creates a normal MCP server entry for `http://127.0.0.1:26316/mcp` with an allowlist that includes status, read, issue, validate, and preview tools only. `officecli_status` reports the active roots, relative path base, binary path, and write state so the model does not have to infer the local working directory. To create or batch-mutate documents, enable provider writes and manually allow `officecli_create_document` or `officecli_apply_edit_plan` in the discovered tool list.

### Verification Commands

```bash
npm run verify:mcp:mock
npm run smoke:mcp
npm run smoke:officecli
npm run compile
npm run build:all
```

For browser manual verification with a loopback server:

```bash
node scripts/mcp-live-mock.mjs --serve
```

Use the printed URL as a Streamable HTTP MCP server in the sidepanel.

### Limits

- Connect timeout: 10,000 ms by default.
- Request timeout: 60,000 ms by default.
- Discovery timeout: 20,000 ms by default.
- Max result bytes: 64,000 by default.
- Max tool count per server: 128 by default.
- Manual chat MCP continuations are capped at 3 rounds; AgentRun continuations are capped at 8 tool loops.

### Local Files

- The extension does not read arbitrary local files or launch stdio MCP processes directly from the browser sandbox.
- Filesystem tools must be exposed by a configured MCP server, Stdio Bridge, or Native Messaging host.
- Keep filesystem MCP roots narrow, and prefer allowlisted project directories over full-disk access.
- Tool call path arguments must still be valid JSON strings. Use `D:/project/file.txt` or escaped backslashes such as `D:\\project\\file.txt`.

### Troubleshooting

- `mcp_origin_permission_denied`: grant host permission from the MCP sidepanel or remove/re-add the server URL.
- `mcp_endpoint_invalid`: use an `http://` or `https://` URL for browser transports.
- `mcp_sse_endpoint_missing`: the SSE server did not emit the endpoint event expected by the legacy transport.
- `mcp_native_host_unavailable`: install or fix the browser native messaging host manifest.
- Local filesystem MCP returns permission errors: check the MCP server or bridge root allowlist. The browser extension cannot bypass that local policy.
- Tool call is shown as a format error: verify the XML tag name is available and the body is a JSON object with escaped backslashes.
- Tool is discovered but not injected: check server enabled state, execution mode, and per-tool allow/deny state.
- Tool executes once but does not continue: verify the current DeepSeek page has the latest extension content script. Manual chat continuations reuse the AgentRun runner and may continue MCP tool calls for up to 3 rounds when tool schemas are still available; scheduled/manual Agent tasks may continue for up to 8 tool loops.
- Stdio server does not start: verify the bridge process, command, args, cwd, and env. The extension itself does not launch stdio processes directly.
- `officecli_binary_missing`: install OfficeCLI or start the provider with `--officecli /path/to/officecli`.
- `officecli_path_denied`: restart the provider with a `--root` that contains the target document.
- `officecli_write_disabled`: restart the provider with `--write enabled`, then explicitly allow the mutation tool in the sidepanel.
- `officecli_file_locked`: close the document in other OfficeCLI resident/watch sessions or external editors, then retry.
- Visible `<officecli_...>` text in the chat with no tool card means the current DeepSeek page did not execute that tag. Refresh the DeepSeek page after reloading the extension or refreshing MCP tools so the content script receives the latest tool descriptor list.
